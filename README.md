# Motif-Search
Find de Novo motif for TF by comparing ChIP-seq and control sequences.
Develop a deep learning model to predict if a piece of DNA sequence can include binding site of the TF.
The model is smallest, and you expand with more channels in convolutional layer and also more layers of convolutional and dense.
